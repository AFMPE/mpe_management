# Azure Mission Partner Environment - Scenario for Terraform & Azure NoOps Accelerator

## Overview

This Mission Partner Environment (MPE) is a scenario that demonstrates how to deploy a set of Azure resources using Terraform. The MPE is intended to be used as a reference for how to deploy Azure resources using Terraform.

## Accounting for Separation of Duties

The steps in the MPE are intended to imitate how an organization could separate the deployment of different Azure components across teamsÂ into separate code repos, or have them executed by different pipelines with specific credentials, even though the code in this repo is contained in a single folder in a single repository.

## Terraform State Management

In this MPE, state is stored in an Azure Storage account that was created out-of-band from the rest of the deployment. All deployments reference this storage account to either store state or reference variables from other parts of the deployment however you may choose to use other tools for state management, like Terraform Cloud after making the necessary code changes.

## Terraform Variable Definitons File

In this MPE, there is a common variable defintions file [parameters.<environment>.tfvars](./tfvars) that is shared across all deployments. Review each section and update the variable definitons file as needed.

## Prerequisites for Deployment

1. Install or upgrade [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
    
    ### To authenticate Azure CLI
    `az login`

    ### To set a specific subscription
    `az account list --output table`<br>
    `az account set --subscription <name-of-subscription>`

2. If not already registered in the subscription, use the following Azure CLI commands to register the required resource providers for Azure Spring Apps:

    `az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.AppPlatform'`

    `az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.ContainerService'`

    `az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.ServiceLinker'`

3. Obtain the ObjectID of the service principal for Azure Spring Apps. This ID is unique per Azure AD Tenant. In Step 4, set the value of variable SRINGAPPS_SPN_OBJECT_ID to the result from this command.

    `az ad sp show --id 0000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000 --query id --output tsv`

4. Modify the variables within the Global section of the variable definitons file paramaters.test.tfvars as needed
